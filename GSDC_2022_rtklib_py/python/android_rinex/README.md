Android GNSS Logger to RINEX converter
======================================


This repository contains a Python script that converts logs from Google's GNSS
measurement tools to RINEX.  It was originally forked from 
https://github.com/rokubun/android_rinex but has been substantially modified.

See gnslogger_to_rnx.py for sample usage and a list of command line options
